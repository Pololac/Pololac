👋 Hi, I’m Paul
  
🌱 As part of a career change after 12 years in journalism, I completed a 12-month training program in web development, followed by another 12-month training program in app developpement focusing on Java. 

On the Front-end side, I covered the following technologies: HTML, CSS (notably using the Bootstrap and Tailwind libraries), JavaScript, Angular, as well as the WordPress CMS.

On the backend, I have extensive experience with PHP (both procedural and object-oriented) and the Symfony framework, as well as hands-on experience with Java and Spring Boot.
