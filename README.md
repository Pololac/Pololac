👋 Hi, I’m Paul
  
🌱 As part of a career change after 12 years in journalism, I completed a 7-month training program in web development. 

On the Front-end side, I covered the following technologies: HTML, CSS (notably using the Bootstrap and Tailwind libraries), JavaScript, Angular, as well as the WordPress CMS.

On the Back-end side, I worked extensively with PHP (both procedural and object-oriented), including experience with the Symfony framework. I created, among other things, a RESTful API in PHP.
